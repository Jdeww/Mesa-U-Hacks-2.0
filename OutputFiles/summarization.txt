*Understanding Data Structures: Focus on Trees and Data Abstraction/Encapsulation*

*Tree Data Structures*

Tree data structures are hierarchical formats that organize data as a series of relationships characterized by parent-child connections. Common real-world applications of tree structures include:

- Folder structures in computer operating systems.
- The hierarchical tag structures in HTML or XML documents.

In each tree, the topmost node is identified as the root, while the nodes beneath it are referred to as child nodes. Each node can have multiple children, allowing for a recursive arrangement that expands across various levels.

**Basic Terminologies in Tree Data Structures:**
- **Parent Node**: The immediate predecessor of a node. For example, B is the parent of D and E.
- **Child Node**: The immediate successor of a node. For example, D and E are child nodes of B.
- **Root Node**: The topmost node in a tree, which lacks a parent. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node.
- **Leaf Node**: Nodes without any children, such as I, J, K, F, G, and H.
- **Ancestor**: A predecessor node on the path from the root to a specific node (e.g., A and B are ancestors of E).
- **Descendant**: A node x is a descendant of node y if y is an ancestor of x.
- **Level of a Node**: The number of edges from the root node to that node; the root is at level 0.
- **Internal Node**: Any node that has at least one child.
- **Sibling**: Nodes that share the same parent.
- **Subtree**: Any node along with its descendants.
  
Trees are classified as non-linear data structures because their data is organized hierarchically rather than in a sequential format, allowing for diverse relationships and efficient data manipulation.

*Data Abstraction and Encapsulation*

Data abstraction involves presenting only the necessary information to the user while hiding implementation details. This reduces complexity and avoids overloading users with irrelevant information. Essentially, it streamlines communication and interaction with programming objects. Closely related is data encapsulation, often referred to as information hiding. This concept focuses on restricting access to certain details and functions of an object, allowing for controlled interaction.
